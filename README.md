This project is a work in progress and in very early stages of development. Expect ugly, bad performant, and crashing code.

The nsew\_client and server code is just for experimentation and to demonstrate how to use the mod.

There's [documentation available online](https://dextercd.github.io/Noita-Synchronise-Expansive-Worlds/).
The online docs correspond with the `main` branch of the [official repository](https://github.com/dextercd/Noita-Synchronise-Expansive-Worlds).
